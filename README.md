Customer Segmentation Project


I used unsupervised learning model (Kmeans) for this dataset. Model seperated into 3 clusters  based that how much money customer spend and  how many time shop from that company.

What was done in the project?

-EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

-Feature engineering

-Visualization

-Using Kmeans

-Testing

Such datasets and projects aim to determine their customer type for company.

Moreover, the analyzes in the EDA section help the company to see their performance in sales such as the most returned product or the best-selling product, as I did.
